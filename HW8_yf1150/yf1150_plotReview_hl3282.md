## Clarity: 
The purpose of data visualization is clear. However, it is better to include x-axis label(longitude), y-axis label(latitude) and title or legends in the first two plots and final plots.

## ESTHETIC: 
The color choices of Figure2 and 4 are not proper enough. It is not easy to distinguish from one area to the other.

## HONESTY: 
In figure3, it is supposed to only show manhattan, but it draws the entire NYC map. It will give an illusion of zero passengers in other districts other than manhattan.
