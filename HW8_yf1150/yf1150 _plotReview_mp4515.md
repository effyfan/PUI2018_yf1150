CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?
The plot is a map of UBER trips originating in NYC over PUMA maps. It is a bit tough to read due to a lot of data points on the map but easy to analyze clusters of places on the second map.ically different.The quantity being shown is a ordinal. Above the graph it is described what each color corresponds to. A label on the map allows for easy interpretaion.

ESTHETIC: The esthetic beauty of the map is pretty good. The data has all not been forced onto 1 map but clearly distributed over the 4 maps. 
HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
Well, the map does not emphasize a particular point but surely does give an overall view of the trips and number of people travelling in each uber trip borough wise, which provides a faint idea of the visualization. So, it surely does provide an idea of the work.
